# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

top 10 peaks climbed worldwide, death rates, danger etc, oxygen deprivation effects on brain

What do you know about?

Well I have experienced a lot of reasonable hikes throughout the USA, none of the top worldwide, but have seen many movies and am interested

What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Different mountains and hikes worldwide based on location
2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?

datasets of age, gender, nationality, etc of climbers of these top 10-20 peaks

4. Answering a question people care about

Outisde factors that can lead to death in the mountain, avalanches, weather patterns, traffic on the mountain

5. Valuable to businesses

This would be valuable based on assessing gear used in mountains and it's reliability. Rope types, Clothing brands, etc

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That mountaineering is dangerous, but the research and time and money that goes into safely planning a trip creates a lot more safety and reduces a lot of risk.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Simpsons example

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Yes. I would hypothesize about Homer's interaction with various characters, which caused him the most grief over time

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Who were Homer's greatest friends, who were his greatest enemies

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I think you could use similar style for my questions because they fit the basic model

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

This I am most curious about. I suspect there are quite a good deal of mountaineering databases involving all the recorded climbs, death rates, etc, but I will have to look more into this.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

Strength and conditioning as it relates to power within various sports

What do you know about?

I have a good deal of extensive personal knowledge as I do a lot of this kind of training myself

What decisions do you face?

Decisions faced in this question most likely come about in specific methods of training, specific exercises, and how they directly pertain to a variety of sports...how they periodize their training and how they transform that strength into sport specific power

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

This is not that useful for this topic, however you could involve different training models from around the world to compare

2. Trend related to the news

This wouldn't really be relevant here either

3. Who does that?

This would be useful in breaking down age range of athletes, specific training among different olympic athletes for example 

4. Answering a question people care about

The people who would find this relevant are aspiring professional athletes, college athletes, olympic athletes, or Strenght and Power coaches for professional or collegic teams

5. Valuable to businesses

Very valuable if you can find specific methods among training that maximize power related to sports, you can then create products and market them accordingly

6. What's the most popular?

You could use specific systems already in place for training to justify which system is more popular, this would be very hard to find data on however

7. Cost/Money rankings

not sure this is relevant

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Enormous misconceptions in how to train for specific sports based on a variety of training methods, among the public, almost 100 percent misconception, and most likely very high even among coaches, as the amount of possible methods and exercises involved is extremely vast

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Now this is what makes me hesitant to do this topic. If I had information on athlete databases and their training methodology, or information regarding say weight training regiments relative to individual sports performance, this would be easier. But as I have personally found with this topic, it seems like the possible ways of combining strength , power, and speed in a variety of different sports is just perhaps too vast to do this particular paper on. I have spent a good deal of my life trying to understand the kinetic chain as it relates to power in the gym and transfers to power through sports performance, and it is really complex...so perhaps I will save this topic for another time.
